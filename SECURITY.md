Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@your-domain.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainer directly

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
5. **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, Xcode version, and package version
6. **Timeline**: Your preferred timeline for disclosure

  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: 30 days

## Security Measures

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Path Traversal Protection**: File system access is restricted to project directories
3. **Command Injection Prevention**: No user input is passed directly to shell commands
4. **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies

### Data Protection

1. **No Sensitive Data Storage**: No API keys or sensitive data are stored
2. **Local Processing**: All code analysis happens locally
3. **Minimal Network Access**: Limited external network requests
4. **Privacy First**: No user data is transmitted to external services

### Access Control

1. **File System Permissions**: Respects system file permissions
2. **Project Scope**: Only accesses files within specified project directories
3. **Configuration Isolation**: User configurations are isolated and secured

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

1. **Verify Installation**: Only install from official sources
   ```bash
   # Official installation
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PolyakPawel/mcp-for-code/main/install.sh | sh
   
   # Or via npm
   npm install -g xcode-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Check Checksums**: Verify package integrity when possible

### Configuration Security

1. **Secure Configuration Files**: Keep configuration files secure
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the package updated to latest version

### Project Security

1. **Project Isolation**: Run only on trusted projects
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions on your projects
3. **Backup Important Code**: Always backup your code before running analysis

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **File System Access**: The tool requires file system access to analyze projects
2. **Project Parsing**: Parses Xcode project files which could contain malicious content
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzes dependency files like Package.swift and Podfile

### Mitigations

1. **Sandboxing**: Runs in user space with limited privileges
2. **Read-Only Operations**: Most operations are read-only
3. **Input Validation**: All file content is validated before processing
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents crashes from malformed files

## Security Updates

### Notification Process

Security updates will be communicated through:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Primary notification method
2. **GitHub Releases**: Release notes will highlight security fixes
3. **NPM Security Advisories**: Automatic notifications for npm users
4. **Email Notifications**: To registered security contacts

### Update Process

1. **Immediate Updates**: Install security updates immediately
2. **Automatic Updates**: Consider enabling automatic updates for patch versions
3. **Testing**: Test updates in development environment first

## Dependency Security

### Regular Audits

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Audit dependencies
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### Dependency Policy

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: We keep dependencies to a minimum
2. **Trusted Sources**: Only use well-maintained, trusted packages
3. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are updated regularly
4. **Security Monitoring**: Automated monitoring for security advisories

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

1. **All Changes Reviewed**: Every code change is reviewed by maintainers
2. **Security Focus**: Reviews include security considerations
3. **Automated Checks**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD

### Testing

1. **Security Tests**: Include security-focused test cases
2. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing of critical components
3. **Fuzzing**: Input fuzzing for parser components

## Compliance

### Standards

We follow industry-standard security practices:

1. **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices
2. **Node.js Security**: Follow Node.js security best practices
3. **TypeScript Security**: Leverage TypeScript for type safety

### Certifications

- No formal certifications currently, but we follow best practices from:
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  - OWASP Top 10
  - Node.js Security Working Group
